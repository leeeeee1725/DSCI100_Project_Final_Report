    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "A research group at UBC, led by Frank Wood, has set up a Minecraft server where they're aiming to create an advanced artificial intelligence that can not only respond to speech, but also behave in a virtual space like Minecraft, just like humans. (Pacific Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence, 2025) To do this, they're collecting data on how humans navigate the Minecraft world.\n",
    "\n",
    "They need help targeting their use of resources to handle the number of players that sign up. There are three questions of interest:\n",
    "- Question 1: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "- Question 2: We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "- Question 3: We are interested in demand forecasting, namely, what time windows are most likely to have large number of simultaneous players. This is because we need to ensure that the number of licenses on hand is sufficiently large to accommodate all parallel players with high probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this report, we are trying to answer Question 1.** Specifically, can player experience level, playtime, gender, and/or age predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter? (**NOTE: discuss what specific question we want to do. we don't have to use all the variables, we can pick and choose. we could also explore predictor variable selection as presented in chapter 6.8 of the textbook?**)\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been given data on the players that have signed up (players.csv), as well as their corresponding play sessions on the server (sessions.csv). As we are looking at player characteristics and behaviours, we will only be looking at players.csv.\n",

    "Some potential issues in the data are: \n",
    "- Possible missing values in played_hours or Age. (There are users who signed up but did not log any hours, and some users did not provide an age.)\n",
    "- All variables are self-reported (except for played_hours). People can easily lie about their information, and this is especially common for age. \n",
    "- When hashing emails, the password that decrypts the emails should be well-protected to avoid issues regarding data leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was likely collected via a sign up form, where users make an profile and provide the information presented in the dataset. Then, any time they play, the hours are logged and linked to their profile. "
