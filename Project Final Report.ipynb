    "In particular, a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, is collecting data about how people play video games. They have set up a MineCraft server, and players' actions are recorded as they navigate through the world. But running this project is not simple: they need to target their recruitment efforts, and make sure they have enough resources (e.g., software licenses, server hardware) to handle the number of players they attract. There are three broad questions of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: We are interested in demand forecasting, namely, what time windows are most likely to have large number of simultaneous players. This is because we need to ensure that the number of licenses on hand is sufficiently large to accommodate all parallel players with high probability. \n",
